### Purpose:
A simple math testing app for an kids.

### Motivation:
My daughter was concern about her 10 year old half brother grades in math class. She and I discuss making an app personalize for him to help him practice math. While she and I didn't work together on the project, I was inspired to make the app for her brother.

### Objectives:
* Learn how to build apps with Angular 6
* The user should be able to do simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division math problems 
* Make it personalize for a boy
* Bonus: Use local storage to save the user name and other data to personalize it more

**Angular:** JavaScript front-end library for building web applications.
 
**Git-Hub:** web-based version control repository and Internet hosting service
 
**Flex-box:** CSS framework for layouts
  
**JavaScript:** object-oriented programming language for web pages
